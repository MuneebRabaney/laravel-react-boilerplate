## This is a simple test that uses Laravel 6 and react 16

The only thing that needs to be done is to set up the server and have it point to the api

All the API Backend code can be found inside server.app.local
All the Client Frontend code can be found inside cleint.app.local

### Installing the Frontend

Use `npm run client:install` to install the dependencies needed for the React frontend client

### Compiling the Frontend in watch mode

use `npm run start:client` from this project root directory to run the compiler in watch mode

### Installing the Backend

Use `npm run server:install` to install the dependencies needed for the Laravel backend client
